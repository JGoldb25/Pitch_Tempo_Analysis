This project analyzes pitch tempo data in relation to wOBA (weighted On-Base Average). The analysis focuses on:
- Pitch tempos for different players
- Correlation between pitch tempo and wOBA
- Identifying outliers and trends

## Files:
- `pitch_tempo_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis
- `pitch_tempo_data.csv`: Data used for pitch tempo analysis
- `woba_data.csv`: Data used for wOBA analysis

## Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Load and clean data
3. Conduct analysis and visualize results
